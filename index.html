<p>I am a very hard working, organized and fast learning person with a good work ethic. I am a very motivated individual with a passion for quality. I have been a stay at home Dad for the past year so this has greatly helped me improve my front end programming skills as i used my extra time to learn more about coding. I can work independently or as part of a team and I have the ability to adapt to change with ease. I am always willing to learn new things and I have a great sense of humor.
